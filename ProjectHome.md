Library is originally written in c++. With this wrapper it can be used in .net framework languages like C# or VB.

This wrapper is written in CLI/C++ and compiled with original library into one mixed assembly. You must compile for x86 platform.

If you do not want to use wrapper you can use SoundToutchNetDLL.cs in root. This class contains function imports from soundtouch dll instead linking it directly.
